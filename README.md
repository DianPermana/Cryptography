## By Definition
*Cryptography* is the practice and study of secure communication techniques that allow for the transformation of information into a format that is unintelligible to unauthorized users, ensuring its confidentiality and integrity

*HMAC* stands for "Hash-Based Message Authentication Code." It is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret key

*Hashing* is a process of converting data (often referred to as a "message") into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number

*Checksum* is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage
